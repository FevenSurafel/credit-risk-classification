# credit-risk-classification

This project uses logistic regression to classify loans as either healthy (0) or high-risk (1) based on historical lending data from a peer-to-peer lending service. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a logistic regression model is trained to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers.

The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix. Based on these results, the model provides a reasonable balance between predicting healthy and high-risk loans, but further tuning may be needed to improve high-risk loan detection.
